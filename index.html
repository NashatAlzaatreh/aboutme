                During my career I have acquired a number of great skills like: communication skills, time management,
                 and computer skills ,but I didn’t feel there was an opportunity to grow or advance further so
                  I decided a change would best for me.

                Fortunately, when I decided to learn software development, I saw ASAC scholarship,
                 it's aim to improve students' programming skills while qualifying them for current
                  and future employment within the tech field.

            <p>
                I started off this ASAC program with no prior formal knowledge in programming.
                By the end of the course, I will have a clearer understanding of what programming 
                is about and the almost limitless things one can do with programming.
                 I am also confident to say now that learning a set of new skills that are not related
                 to my feild of study is something absolutely do-able.

                I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort 
                and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages 
                and development techniques are important to me
